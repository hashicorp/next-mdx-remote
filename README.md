## Installation

```sh
# using npm
npm i next-mdx-remote

# using yarn
yarn add next-mdx-remote
```

## Examples

```jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

While it may seem strange to see these two in the same file, this is one of the cool things about Next.js -- `getStaticProps` and `TestPage`, while appearing in the same file, run in two different places. Ultimately your browser bundle will not include `getStaticProps` at all, or any of the functions it uses only on the server, so `serialize` will be removed from the browser bundle entirely.

> **IMPORTANT**: Be very careful about putting any `mdx-remote` code into a separate "utilities" file. Doing so will likely cause issues with nextjs' code splitting abilities - it must be able to cleanly determine what is used only on the server side and what should be left in the client bundle. If you put `mdx-remote` code into an external utilities file and something is broken, remove it and start from the simple example above before filing an issue.

### Additional Examples

<details>
  <summary>Parsing Frontmatter</summary>

Markdown in general is often paired with frontmatter, and normally this means adding some extra custom processing to the way markdown is handled. To address this, `next-mdx-remote` comes with optional parsing of frontmatter, which can be enabled by passing `parseFrontmatter: true` to `serialize`.

Here's what that looks like:

```jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function TestPage({ mdxSource }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>{mdxSource.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = `---
title: Test
---

Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test name={title}/>
  `

  const mdxSource = await serialize(source, { parseFrontmatter: true })
  return { props: { mdxSource } }
}
```

_[`vfile-matter`](https://github.com/vfile/vfile-matter) is used to parse the frontmatter._

<details>
  <summary>Passing custom data to a component with `scope`</summary>

`<MDXRemote />` accepts a `scope` prop, which makes all of the values available for use in your MDX.

Each key/value pair in the `scope` argument will be exposed as a javascript variable. So, for example, you could imagine if you had a scope like `{ foo: 'bar' }`, it would be interpreted as `const foo = 'bar'`.

This specifically means that you need to make sure that key names in your `scope` argument are valid javascript variable names. For example, passing in `{ 'my-variable-name': 'bar' }` would generate an _error_, because the key name is not a valid javascript variable name.

It's also important to note that `scope` variables must be consumed as _arguments to a component_, they cannot be rendered in the middle of text. This is shown in the example below.

```jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }
const data = { product: 'next' }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} scope={data} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source =
    'Some **mdx** text, with a component using a scope variable <Test product={product} />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Passing `scope` into the `serialize` function instead</summary>

You can also pass custom data into `serialize`, which will then pass the value through and make it available from its result. By spreading the result from `source` into `<MDXRemote />`, the data will be made available.

Note that any scope values passed into `serialize` need to be serializable, meaning passing functions or components is not possible. Additionally, any key named in the `scope` argument must be valid javascript variable names. If you need to pass custom scope that is not serializable, you can pass `scope` directly to `<MDXRemote />` where it's rendered. There is an example of how to do this above this section.

```jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }
const data = { product: 'next' }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source =
    'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test product={product} />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source, { scope: data })
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Custom components from <code>MDXProvider</code><a id="mdx-provider"></a>
  </summary>

If you want to make components available to any `<MDXRemote />` being rendered in your application, you can use [`<MDXProvider />`](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#mdx-provider) from `@mdx-js/react`.

```jsx
// pages/_app.jsx
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}
```

```jsx
// pages/test.jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Component names with dot (e.g. <code>motion.div</code>)
  </summary>

Component names that contain a dot (`.`), such as those from `framer-motion`, can be rendered the same way as other custom components, just pass `motion` in your components object.

```js
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={{ motion }} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = `Some **mdx** text, with a component:

<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />`
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Lazy hydration</summary>

Lazy hydration defers hydration of the components on the client. This is an optimization technique to improve the initial load of your application, but may introduce unexpected delays in interactivity for any dynamic content within your MDX content.

_Note: this will add an additional wrapping `div` around your rendered MDX, which is necessary to avoid [hydration mismatches during render](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate)._

```jsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} lazy />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

</details>

## APIs

This library exposes a function and a component, `serialize` and `<MDXRemote />`. These two are purposefully isolated into their own files -- `serialize` is intended to be run **server-side**, so within `getStaticProps`, which runs on the server/at build time. `<MDXRemote />` on the other hand is intended to be run on the client side, in the browser.

- **`serialize(source: string, { mdxOptions?: object, scope?: object, parseFrontmatter?: boolean })`**

  **`serialize`** consumes a string of MDX. It can also optionally be passed options which are [passed directly to MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/), and a scope object that can be included in the mdx scope. The function returns an object that is intended to be passed into `<MDXRemote />` directly.

  ```ts
  serialize(
    // Raw MDX contents as a string
    '# hello, world',
    // Optional parameters
    {
      // made available to the arguments of any custom mdx component
      scope: {},
      // MDX's available options, see the MDX docs for more info.
      // https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#compilefile-options
      mdxOptions: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [],
        format: 'mdx',
      },
      // Indicates whether or not to parse the frontmatter from the mdx source
      parseFrontmatter: false,
    }
  )
  ```

  Visit <https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#compilefile-options> for available `mdxOptions`.

- **`<MDXRemote compiledSource={string} components?={object} scope?={object} lazy?={boolean} />`**

  **`<MDXRemote />`** consumes the output of `serialize` as well as an optional components argument. Its result can be rendered directly into your component. To defer hydration of the content and immediately serve the static markup, pass the `lazy` prop.

  ```ts
  <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
  ```

### Replacing default components

Rendering will use [`MDXProvider`](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#mdx-provider) under the hood. This means you can replace HTML tags by custom components. Those components are listed in MDXJS [Table of components](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/).

An example use case is rendering the content with your preferred styling library.

```jsx
import { Typography } from "@material-ui/core";

const components = { Test, h2: (props) => <Typography variant="h2" {...props} /> }
...
```

If you prefer, you can also wrap your entire application in an `<MDXProvider />` instead of passing your components directly to `<MDXRemote />`. See the [example](#mdx-provider) above.

Note: `th/td` won't work because of the "/" in the component name.

## Background & Theory

There isn't really a good default way to load mdx files in a Next.js app. Previously, we wrote [`next-mdx-enhanced`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) in order to be able to render your MDX files into layouts and import their front matter to create index pages.

This workflow from mdx-enhanced was fine, but introduced a few limitations that we have removed with `next-mdx-remote`:

- **The file content must be local.** You cannot store MDX files in another repo, a database, etc. For a large enough operation, there will end up being a split between those authoring content and those working on presentation of the content. Overlapping these two concerns in the same repo makes a more difficult workflow for everyone.
- **You are bound to filesystem-based routing.** Your pages are generated with urls according to their locations. Or maybe you remap them using `exportPathMap`, which creates confusion for authors. Regardless, moving pages around in any way breaks things -- either the page's url or your `exportPathMap` configuration.
- **You will end up running into performance issues.** Webpack is a JavaScript bundler, forcing it to load hundreds/thousands of pages of text content will blow out your memory requirements. Webpack stores each page as a distinct object with a large amount of metadata. One of our implementations with a couple hundred pages hit more than 8GB of memory required to compile the site. Builds took more than 25 minutes.
- **You will be limited in the ways you are able to structure relational data.** Organizing content into dynamic, related categories is difficult when your entire data structure is front matter parsed into javascript objects and held in memory.

So, `next-mdx-remote` changes the entire pattern so that you load your MDX content not through an import, but rather through `getStaticProps` or `getServerProps` -- you know, the same way you would load any other data. The library provides the tools to serialize and hydrate the MDX content in a manner that is performant. This removes all of the limitations listed above, and does so at a significantly lower cost -- `next-mdx-enhanced` is a very heavy library with a lot of custom logic and [some annoying limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced/issues/17). Our informal testing has shown build times reduced by 50% or more.

Since this project was initially created, Kent C Dodds has made a similar project, [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). This library supports imports and exports within a mdx file (as long as you manually read each imported file and pass its contents) and automatically processes frontmatter. If you have a lot of files that all import and use different components, you may benefit from using `mdx-bundler`, as `next-mdx-remote` currently only allows components to be imported and made available across all pages. It's important to note that this functionality comes with a cost though - `mdx-bundler`'s output is at least 400% larger than the output from `next-mdx-remote` for basic markdown content.

### How Can I Build A Blog With This?

Data has shown that 99% of use cases for all developer tooling are building unnecessarily complex personal blogs. Just kidding. But seriously, if you are trying to build a blog for personal or small business use, consider just using normal html and css. You definitely do not need to be using a heavy full-stack javascript framework to make a simple blog. You'll thank yourself later when you return to make an update in a couple years and there haven't been 10 breaking releases to all of your dependencies.

If you really insist though, check out [our official nextjs example implementation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote). 💖

## Caveats

### Environment Targets

The code generated by `next-mdx-remote`, which is used to actually render the MDX targets browsers with module support. If you need to support older browsers, consider transpiling the `compiledSource` output from `serialize`.

### `import` / `export`

`import` and `export` statements cannot be used **inside** an MDX file. If you need to use components in your MDX files, they should be provided as a prop to `<MDXRemote />`.

Hopefully this makes sense, since in order to work, imports must be relative to a file path, and this library allows content to be loaded from anywhere, rather than only loading local content from a set file path. As for exports, the MDX content is treated as data, not a **module**, so there is no way for us to access any value which may be exported from the MDX passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

## Security

This library evaluates a string of JavaScript on the client side, which is how it MDXRemotes the MDX content. Evaluating a string into javascript can be a dangerous practice if not done carefully, as it can enable XSS attacks. It's important to make sure that you are only passing the `mdxSource` input generated by the `serialize` function to `<MDXRemote />`, as instructed in the documentation. **Do not pass user input into `<MDXRemote />`.**

If you have a CSP on your website that disallows code evaluation via `eval` or `new Function()`, you will need to loosen that restriction in order to utilize `next-mdx-remote`, which can be done using [`unsafe-eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#common_sources).

## TypeScript

This project does include native types for TypeScript use. Both `serialize` and `<MDXRemote />` have types normally as you'd expect, and the library also exports a type which you can use to type the result of `getStaticProps`.

- `MDXRemoteSerializeResult<TScope = Record<string, unknown>>`: Represents the return value of `serialize`. The `TScope` generic type can be passed to represent the type of the scoped data you pass in.

Below is an example of a simple implementation in TypeScript. You may not need to implement the types exactly in this way for every configuration of TypeScript - this example is just a demonstration of where the types could be applied if needed.

```tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote, MDXRemoteSerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote'
import ExampleComponent from './example'

const components = { ExampleComponent }

interface Props {
  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult
}

export default function ExamplePage({ mdxSource }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<{
  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult
}> = async () => {
  const mdxSource = await serialize('some *mdx* content: <ExampleComponent />')
  return { props: { mdxSource } }
}
```

## React Server Components (RSC) & Next.js `app` Directory Support

> **Warning**
> Server Components and Next.js's `app` directory are unstable, and so we consider the `next-mdx-remote/rsc` API to be unstable as well. Use at your own discretion, and be aware that the API and behavior might change between minor and/or patch releases.

Usage of `next-mdx-remote` within server components, and specifically within Next.js's `app` directory (beta), is supported by importing from `next-mdx-remote/rsc`. Previously, the serialization and render steps were separate, but going forward RSC makes this separation unnecessary.

Some noteworthy differences:

- `<MDXRemote />` now accepts a `source` prop, instead of accepting the serialized output from `next-mdx-remote/serialize`
- Custom components can no longer be provided by using the `MDXProvider` context from `@mdx-js/react`, as RSC does not support React Context
- To access frontmatter outside of your MDX when passing `parseFrontmatter: true`, use the `compileMdx` method exposed from `next-mdx-remote/rsc`
- The `lazy` prop is no longer supported, as the rendering happens on the server
- `<MDXRemote />` must be rendered on the server, as it is now an async component. Client components can be rendered as part of the MDX markup

For more information on RSC, check out the [Next.js beta documentation](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#server-components).

### Examples

_Assuming usage in a Next.js 13+ application using the `app` directory._

#### Basic

```tsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'

// app/page.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      source={`
      # Hello World

      This is from Server Components!
      `}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Loading state

```tsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'

// app/page.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    // Ideally this loading spinner would ensure there is no layout shift,
    // this is an example for how to provide such a loading spinner.
    // In Next.js you can also use `loading.js` for this.
    <Suspense fallback={<>Loading...</>}>
      <MDXRemote
        source={`
        # Hello World

        This is from Server Components!
        `}
      />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

#### Custom Components

```tsx
// components/mdx-remote.js
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'

const components = {
  h1: (props) => (
    <h1 {...props} className="large-text">
      {props.children}
    </h1>
  ),
}

export function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
    />
  )
}
```

```tsx
// app/page.js
import { CustomMDX } from '../components/mdx-remote'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <CustomMDX
      // h1 now renders with `large-text` className
      source={`
      # Hello World
      This is from Server Components!
    `}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Access Frontmatter outside of MDX

```tsx
// app/page.js
import { compileMDX } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

export default async function Home() {
  const {content, frontmatter} = compileMDX({
     source: `
      ---
      title: RSC Frontmatter Example
      ---
      # Hello World
      This is from Server Components!
    `
    options: { parseFrontmatter: true }
  })
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      {content}
   </>
  );
}
```
